-- | This module provides a Haskell representation of Haskell
-- types. It is similar to the Data.Typeable built-in module, but it
-- differs in that it can represent polymorphic types (that is, types
-- with type variables in them), and that the type constructors within
-- the types are encoded using our HyphenTyCon.TyCon type rather than
-- Data.Typeable.TyCon: ours contains a bit more information (to wit,
-- the kind and some information on how the type constructor can be
-- 'found' in importable modules; see comments in HyphenTyCon for
-- details).
--
-- Although (as mentioned above) we can represent polymorphic types,
-- every type we represent has a fixed kind: we don't handle
-- Kind-polymorphic beasts like @(a Text)@ where @a@ is a type
-- variable. (This could have kind @*@, if @a@ has Kind @* -> *@, but
-- could also have Kind @* -> *@, if @a@ had kind @* -> * -> *@, and
-- so on...)

----

-- | Our representation for a Haskell type. The only 'true' fields
-- here are typeHead and typeTail; all the other fields are computed
-- from them and only present in the constructor for efficiency (so
-- that, once computed, we remember their values). The head of a type
-- is either a Type constructor, or a Variable with a kind. (Types
-- like @((a :: * -> * -> *) Text Text)@ are legal in Haskell, but
-- very rare). Note that in this example the Kind of the Variable must
-- be fixed because we do not support Kind polymorphism of any nature:
-- see second paragraph of comment at the top of the file.) The tail
-- of the type is the set of other types to which the constructor has
-- been applied.
--
-- Note that not all combinations of typeHead and typeTail are
-- allowed: there might be a kind mismatch.
--
-- The smart constructors mkHsTypeSafe and mkHsType are the preferred
-- way of building HsTypes from the 'true' fields.
--
-- typeHash is a hash or fingerprint for the type, stored once for
-- fast access. typeKind is the Kind of the type as a whole: this can
-- be figured out by taking the kind of the head and imagining that
-- @N@ arguments have already been provided to it, where @N@ is the
-- number of elemetns of the typeTail. typeFreeVars are all the free
-- type variables in the type, together with the kinds they must have
-- for the expression to make sense; this can be gleaned by scanning
-- recursively for variables. typeName is the name of the type in
-- standard Haskell notation.

-- | A very technical but very important role in hyphen is played by
-- *type forcers*, which exist only for *monomorphic* types. The idea
-- of a type forcer is that it's a string that we can pass to the
-- haskell compiler which will evaluate to the identity function on a
-- particular type in question. The point of this is that we can apply
-- such a thing to an polymorphic expression to produce a monomorphic
-- realization of (the object encoded by) that expression.
--
-- In simple cases, this is just a matter of writing @(id :: <type> ->
-- <type>)@. Not all cases are this simple, however, because sometimes
-- we just can't name the type in question (so we can't write
-- something that would go in the spot @<type>@ there). This is
-- because it's possible for a Haskell module locally define a type
-- constructor X and to export an entity whose type involves a X
-- without exporting X. (This is considered by some to be a wart.) In
-- our world, we see this in that not every @TyCLocation@ is built
-- using @InExplicitModuleNamed@. So in more general cases, we end up
-- doing something like the following. Pretend that [] is never
-- exported. Then we can force something to have type [Int] by passing
-- it through:
--
-- @
--   (((const $ id) :: (x a -> a) -> x Int -> x Int) head)
-- @
--
-- The basic idea here is that since head has type @[u] -> u@, to
-- applying the @(const $ id)@ to head forces the @x@ in the
-- explicitly given type signature to mean @[]@, so the @id@ we get is
-- actually @id : [Int] -> [Int])@. Tada!
--
-- The rest of the code here is just a matter of doing this in
-- general. We write a function from HsTypes to Texts that builds the
-- name of the type which we want to force to (@x Int@) assuming that
-- certain type variables (@x@ in this case) have been forced to be
-- synonyms for certain type constructors. This code is in a WriterT
-- monad transformer, and as it goes along it writes out pairs like
-- @('head', 'x a')@ which means that @x@ will be forced be a synonym
-- for the type constructor we want if we ensure that @x a@ matches
-- the type of @head@. As we build this, we need a good supply of type
-- variables, so we also have a state monad transformer to keep track
-- of the next fresh variable. We acutally (for human convenience) use
-- two stocks of variables: 'x variables' (which are variables that
-- will eventually be set to type constructors we want to use) and 'a
-- variables' which are just padding.
