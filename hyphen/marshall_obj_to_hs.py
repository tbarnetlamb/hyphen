"""This module has two functions:

a) The first is to handle the automatic marshalling of Python objects
(provided by the library user) into Haskell objects that can be passed
to Haskell functions that the user wishes to invoke. A given python
object will often be able to be marshalled into *several* different
Haskell objects, of different types. Thus, the marshalling operation
takes as inputs a python object *and the desired type of the
marshalled Haskell object* and gnerates a Haskell object of the
desired type (which cannot be polymorphic).

b) The second function supports the first. If we apply a polymorphic
Haskell function (like length) to a python object like [1, 2, 3], we
would like to infer that we really want to apply the
[Integer]->Integer version, and not any other version. So we provide
functionality for 'guessing' the Haskell type that a given python
object 'most' wants to convert to. (Even though it might, as discussed
in point a, actually be able to convert itself into objects of other
Haskell types.)

The actual infrastructure for both (a) and (b) works via a series of
hooks, so users can extend the built-in handing if they so desire.

## The first part of the file handles marshalling a python object to a
## Haskell object where the type of the desired Haskell object is
## specified.
##
## The basic structure, as mentioned above, works via a series of
## hooks.

## The first kind of hook works based on the python type of the object
## we're trying to marshall. Such a hook is installed by writing into
## the following dictionary; the key is the python type in question,
## the value is a function which takes arguments
## (python_object_to_marshall, haskell_type_to_which_we_are_marshalling)
## and returns an appropriately marshalled Haskell object. If you
## install a hook for type T, it is inherited by all derived classes
## (but may be overridden for derived classes).
hs_to_py_per_pytype_hooks = {}

## The second kind of hook will only be used if no hook of the first
## kind was applicable. It is simply a function which takes arguments
## (python_object_to_marshall, haskell_type_to_which_we_are_marshalling)
## and decides if it wants to be responsible for the conversion. If it
## does, it returns <marshalled_haskell_object>; if not it returns
## None. Hooks should be placed in the following list; we try them
## from begining to end, and stop as soon as a hook claims to be able
## to handle the object we're converting.
hs_to_py_general_hooks    = []

## The final type of hook (which will only be used if there was no
## match for either of the previous two kinds of hook) applies based
## on the Haskell type to which we're trying to marshall the python
## value: specifically, based on the Type Constructor at the head of
## the type. To install such a hook, insert into the following
## dictionary; the key is the hslowlevel TyCon object representing the
## type constructor in question; the value is a function which takes
## arguments (python_object_to_marshall,
## haskell_type_to_which_we_are_marshalling) and returns an
## appropriately marshalled Haskell object.

## This table will have several hooks pre-installed, and we define the
## assosciated conversion functions now... it is probably good for the
## reader to read the dictionary below before reading these functions!

def pyobj_hstype_hint(py_obj, known_so_far=None, fv_src=None):
    """Code for deciding the default Haskell type to which we should
    convert a given python object. Sometimes we already know something
    about the shape of the Haskell object we're looking to create
    (e.g. we might know it's a list of something; in this case, what
    we know is provided as a HsType called known_so_far; this type
    will generally be polymorphic to express our limited knowledge
    about the type we're aiming for (if it's monomorphic, we can just
    return known_so_far!) So, for instance, if we know we're trying to
    form a list of something, then known_so_far would be an HsType
    representing "[a]", and we have to inspect py_obj to decide what a
    should be then return a HsType telling us what the type of the
    list should be; say "[Integer]" if py_obj is [1, 2, 3].

    known_so_far being None is equivalent to it being HsType('a') for
    some type variable 'a' (i.e. a Haskell type that conveys no
    information whatsoever).

    [Incidentally, the reason that a hint is supplied rather than just
    providing py_obj is the fact that a given python object might
    support conversion to many types; for instance the default
    rendering of the python tuple (1, 2) into Haskell is as a Haskell
    tuple, but it could also convert to a list if necessary; and we'd
    like to make sure that if it's used in a context where a Haskell
    list is needed, things Just Work.

    For example:
    >>> str(pyobj_hstype_hint((1, 2), None))  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    '<hyphen.HsType object representing (GHC...Integer, GHC...Integer)>'
    >>> str(pyobj_hstype_hint((1, 2), hs_List(hslowlevel.HsType('a'))))    # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    '<hyphen.HsType object representing [GHC...Integer]>'

    ]

    Sometimes, we cannot fully guess the type to which py_obj can best
    be converted but we can provide some information (e.g. we might
    know it's a function but not what the return type should be). In
    this case, we return a polymorphic type which is 'less
    polymorphic' than known_so_far but which is still not monomorphic.

    In doing this, we may need to insert some type variables. fv_src
    should be an iterator which yields a sequence of distinct strings
    to use as type variables which are 'safe to use' in whatever
    context we're working. If it's None, we make up free variables
    ourselves, being careful to avoid any type variables already
    mentioned in known_so_far.
