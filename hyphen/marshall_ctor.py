"""Haskell *type constructors* and *data constructors* that the user
imports to python are transformed into python <type> objects. If we
create types for several data constructors (X, Y and Z, say) for a
given type constructor (T, say), then the corresponding python <type>
objects that we create will be related by inheritance; X Y and Z will
derive from T. This allows us to do isinstance(foo, T) or
isinstance(foo, X) and get sensible answers. Continuing the example,
the Python type created to represent T will itself derive from HsObj
(defined in hsobj.py) which gives a bunch of basic-level behaviors
which we want to be common to all Python objects which wrap Haskell
objects.

(Even if the Haskell type constructor has parameters, we create a
single python type object for all Haskell types associated to the
constructor. So, for instance, we create a single python type
hs.Data.Map to represent all the Haskell types Map a b for any a and
b.)

We generally want the Python objects we build to represent Haskell
objects to be 'friendly'; we want (for instance) Set a to support
haskell 'A in B' notation, Map a b to support substripting, and
Haskell functions to give rise to callable python objects. As is
idiomatic for python, we generally achieve such behaviours by
including suitable functionality in the corresponding python
class. So, since this code generates the relevant Python type objects,
the work to put the right behaviors into them happens here. As is
usual for hyphen, we do this via a series of hooks, so users can
extend the built-in handing if they so desire. See the fifth section
below.

# As we create python type objects which correspond to Haskell type
# constructors and data constructors, we cache them; we do this both
# so that each Haskell tycon or dacon has only one python type
# corresponding to it, and also for efficiency. The cache is stored in
# the following dictionary. The type corresponding to a given haskell
# tycon is marshall_cache[tycon], where 'tycon' is the Haskell Type
# Constructor object exposed by the low level Haskell bridge (such
# objects are hashable). The python type corresponding to a Haskell
# data constructor is marshall_cache[(corresponding_tycon,
# dacon_name)], where corresponding_tycon is the tycon to which the
# data-constructor belongs, and dacon_name is a string giving the name
# of the data constructor. (We can't use the low-level haskell bridge
# obejct correesponding to the data constructor, because that would be
# an HsObjRaw, which is necessarily not hashable.)
