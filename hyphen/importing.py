"""The purpose of this module is to interact with the python import
system so that, once hyphen itself has been imported and has installed
its hooks, you can write import hs.<blah> and we will import the
appropriate Haskell module for you.

There are also a couple of slight impedance mismatches between Haskell
and Python modules, which have workarounds implemented by this
module. More precisely:

a) Haskell modules have *two* namespaces [1]; a type/type constructor
namespace and a plain object namespace, and it is possible to have the
same name defined in both namespaces (although because of
capitalization rules, the object in this case will necessarily be a
Data constructor). Python has only a single namespace, so we must
somehow resolve this contention. (We generally do this by creating a
lightweight 'doublet' object; then you can do MyName.the_tycon or
MyName.the_dacon to specify exactly what you mean. There is one
exception to this, which is when you have a type constructor with only
one data constructor which has the same name as the type
constructor. This is a common pattern in Haskell and it's annoying to
have to do the .the_dacon stuff in this case; and furthermore, little
confusion is saved by forcing the user to spell things out in this
case. So in this case we have MyName refer to the data constructor,
which is probably what you mean, and allow you to write
MyName.the_type to get the type constructor.)

b) Haskell modules can have entries with names like '+++' which are
not legal pyhton identifiers. We still want them to be accessible from
Python, and do this by giving the imported module a special '_'
member, which is a dictionary mapping awkward names like '++' to the
appropriate object.

c) In python, when we import a module a.b.c, we necessarily also
import the packages a and a.b first. In Haskell the existence of a
module Data.Text doesn't necessarily imply the existence of a module
'Data' (and in fact no such module exists). When the user writes
'import hs.Data.Text', python will direct us to import 'hs.Data',
which will cause us to look for the Haskell module 'Data', and if we
proceeded naively we would fail when we found it didn't exist. We
solve this problem in a rudimentary way: we have a list of particular
'non-modules' X such that X is not expected to be a Haskell module
even though X.Something is. When we are told to import hs.X (probably
because the user imported hs.X.Something), we still *attempt* to load
a Haskell module X, but if we don't find one, we don't throw an
error. (This bahavior is controlled by the EXPECTED_EMPTY list below.)

[Even when a module X exists, it's not necessarily the case that every
user who imports X.Foo will want to import X. An egregious case of
this is where X=GHC; we often want to import GHC.<something> (most of
the GHC built-in types live here) but almost never want to import GHC
(which is enormous, and very slow to import, and which contains the
GHC compiler itself as a library). So we also have a list
FORCED_EMPTY; if we are asked to import some X which is on this list,
we always return an empty module rather than trying to import the
actual Haskell module with that name.

[footnote 1] In fact, Haskell officially has 6 namespaces in play:
type constructors, data constructors, type variables, plain objects,
infix operators and infix data constructors. But type variables can
never be exported, so they're out of the picture in terms of what you
might find in a module, and then the only actual *collisions* that are
possible are between type constructors and data constructors because
capitalization distinguishes the constuctors from the plain objects
that aren't data constructors, and because the infixes are
non-alphanumeric (and the two types of infixes are disambiguated based
on whether there's an initial ':'). So for our purposes we think of
there being just two namespaces: type constructors, and 'everything
else'.
